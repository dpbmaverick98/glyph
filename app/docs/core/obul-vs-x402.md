# Obul vs x402

**x402** is a protocol standard.  
**Obul** is a service built on x402.

Think of it like HTTP and NGINX:
- HTTP is the protocol
- NGINX is a server that implements HTTP

Similarly:
- x402 is the payment protocol
- Obul is a facilitator that implements x402

## When to Use Raw x402

Build your own x402 integration if:

✅ You have dedicated blockchain engineering resources  
✅ You need complete control over the payment flow  
✅ You have specific compliance requirements  
✅ You're building a facilitator service yourself  

**What you'll build:**

```
Your Stack:
├── Wallet infrastructure
├── USDC on-ramp procedure
├── Transaction signing service
├── Payment verification logic
├── Retry and error handling
├── Monitoring and alerting
└── Analytics dashboard
```

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for initial implementation, ongoing maintenance forever.

## When to Use Obul

Choose Obul if:

✅ You want to ship fast  
✅ You don't have blockchain expertise  
✅ You prefer managed infrastructure  
✅ You need production reliability  

**What you get:**

```
Obul Stack:
├── Managed proxy layer
├── Automatic x402 handling
├── Production security
├── Real-time dashboard
└── Easy card checkout
```

**Timeline:** 5 minutes to first payment.

## Migration: Obul → Raw x402

Obul uses the open x402 standard. You're never locked in.

If you outgrow Obul:

1. Export your transaction history

3. Update your client code to use new facilitator
4. Gradual cutover

**No data hostage situation. No proprietary formats. Just open standards.**
