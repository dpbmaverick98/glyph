cd my-docs
npm run dev
```

Write your docs in Markdown. Glyph handles the rest—syntax highlighting, tables, callouts, and more.

### 🎨 Customizable

Easy theming with CSS variables. Change colors, fonts, and layout to match your brand.

### 🤖 LLM-Friendly

Automatically generates `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` so AI assistants can understand your documentation.
