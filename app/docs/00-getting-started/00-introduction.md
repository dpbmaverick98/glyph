# What is Glyph?

Glyph is a **documentation framework with personality**. It helps you create beautiful, fast, and unique documentation sites from Markdown files.

## The Problem

Most documentation sites look the same:
- ❌ Boring, generic designs
- ❌ Complex setup and configuration
- ❌ Locked into proprietary platforms
- ❌ Hard to customize beyond colors

## The Solution

Glyph gives you:
- ✅ **8 unique themes** - From minimal to cyberpunk
- ✅ **Zero config** - Works out of the box
- ✅ **Fully open source** - Own your docs
- ✅ **Easy customization** - React + Tailwind

## What Makes Glyph Different?

### Themes with Personality

Most docs frameworks give you light/dark mode. Glyph gives you **8 completely different aesthetics**:

- **Minimal** - Clean, Apple-inspired
- **Pixel** - Retro 8-bit gaming
- **Glass** - Glassmorphism effects
- **Brutalist** - Bold Swiss design
- **Cyber** - Neon cyberpunk
- **Terminal** - Command-line hacker vibe
- **Halloween** - Spooky orange & purple
- **Synthwave** - Sunset gradients

Switch themes instantly. No rebuild required.

### Built for Developers

```bash
# Create new docs
npx create glyph-docs@latest my-docs

# Start dev server
cd my-docs && npm run dev

# Deploy
npm run build
```

That's it. No complex configuration. No wrestling with themes.
